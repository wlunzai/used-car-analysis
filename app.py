        - Location where car are listed for sale
        - Car Transmission type (Automatic or Manual)
        - Car License plate type (even plate or odd plate)

        As such, we are able to add one more car attributes to the above list:
        - Engine CC

        As some of the used car has multiple features, another attributes on total feature available on the car was added into the analysis as well.
